|---|---|---|---|
| S1.1 | The sixteen colour roles ship as CSS custom properties for both mocha and latte, lifted from the Face's own `color.go` rather than from upstream Catppuccin, with a test that fails when any role misses the Face's contrast bar (text ≥4.5:1, semantics and overlay ≥3:1, quiet roles ≥1.5:1 and ordered) | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.2 | Typography and spacing: a humanist sans body at a 62–72ch measure through the Astro Fonts API consuming `cssVariable`, monospace reserved for machine truth, and a type scale used by name — no page hardcodes a size or a hex | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.3 | The layout shell — top bar, three sections, reading column, sticky in-page TOC on wide viewports — plus a theme toggle that follows `prefers-color-scheme`, persists to `localStorage`, and survives first paint without a flash | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.4 | The template's two `checkPlaceholders` `allow:` escapes are deleted and the build is green without them, so this site's own copy is guarded from here on | ✅ DONE | [`b05efc3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/b05efc3) |

|---|---|---|---|
| S2.1 | `concepts`, `articles` and `reports` exist as typed collections — Zod-only schemas in `schema.ts`, loaders in `content.config.ts`, an entry each in the `editable` map — with the concept schema carrying the five-move shape from SPEC Part III including `evidence` as keys rather than values | ✅ DONE | [`a68c0f3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a68c0f3) |
| S2.2 | The three index pages and the nav render from the collections, ordered by `order`, with `readNext` resolving to real entries and a build that fails on a dangling one | ✅ DONE | [`a68c0f3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a68c0f3) |
| S2.3 | Every page carries `data-sk-edit` annotations that resolve, real `meta.description` and `meta.ogDescription`, and `npm run check` reports zero errors | ✅ DONE | [`a6d5f98`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a6d5f98) |
| S2.4 | One concept page is written end to end as the worked example that proves the shape holds, and it passes all three litmus tests in SPEC Part I | ✅ DONE | [`a6d5f98`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a6d5f98) |

|---|---|---|---|
| S3.1 | `scripts/harvest.mjs` reads `conductor history --json --limit 0` for run-level truth and read-only SQLite for what that does not expose (costs by category, gate pass rates, bugs, scores, event counts, rollovers), and writes `src/data/corpus.json` | ✅ DONE | - |
| S3.2 | `anonymise.json` maps run id → published scenario label, and the harvest **fails closed**: a run with no entry is excluded from the corpus rather than published under its real name, proven by a test that adds an unmapped run | ✅ DONE | - |
| S3.3 | The evidence strip component renders figures from `corpus.json` by key, and a page that names a key absent from the corpus fails the build rather than rendering blank | ✅ DONE | [`0f5f4c9`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/0f5f4c9) |
| S3.4 | The `evidence` gate re-runs the harvest and goes red when `corpus.json` is stale or a cited key is missing, proven by a deliberate staleness both ways | ✅ DONE | [`0f5f4c9`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/0f5f4c9) |

| S4.2 | Concepts 4–6 (token economics, evals and gates, independent verification) written to the same bar | ✅ DONE | [`690304d`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/690304d) |
| S4.3 | Concepts 7–8 (durable execution, human-in-the-loop) written to the same bar | ✅ DONE | [`adbe41f`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/adbe41f) |
| S4.4 | Concepts 9–10 (agent observability, agent memory) written, the spine reads in `order` end to end, and every `file:line` citation is verified to still resolve against `shaahink/conductor` at a named commit | ✅ DONE | [`adbe41f`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/adbe41f) |

## Last gate run

site-fast:OK · generated:OK · evidence:OK

## Last session result

> **Two S5 articles landed with fresh evidence; harvest now sources money figures from the verb**
> - **S5.1** — "What an autonomous run actually costs": 1,629 words, zero figures in prose, 15 evidence keys. SPEC's hand-derived waste figures re-verified against `conductor money`: the dearest stage of `the-fleet-backlog` is **$52.06 / 23.2% …
> - **S5.2** — "Never believe the agent": 1,394 words, 11 evidence keys, argued from the 29 red gates. New measurement nobody publishes: **four of the 29 red gates never ran** — exit status `0xC0000142`, 21–178 ms against neighbours of 8–673 s …
> - **QA of session 10: no findings.** Battery re-run green from a clean tree before the first edit; the "18 pages" in its handoff is the dist HTML count, the gate's "16 pages" is pages carrying annotations — both true.
>
> artefacts: `src/content/articles/what-a-run-costs.yaml`, `src/content/articles/never-believe-the-agent.yaml`, `scripts/harvest.mjs` (readMoney, source-based guard, four new gate counts), `test/harvest.test.mjs` (+4 tests), `src/data/corpus.json`; commits `1ef5db5`, `1c56db4`
>
> evidence: `docs/evidence/S5.1-what-a-run-costs.md`, `docs/evidence/S5.2-never-believe-the-agent.md` — 0 errors, 49 tests, build exit 0 with 306 annotations on 17 pages, evidence gate current over 13 cited entries; typed-figure gate and the new source gate each proved red by mutation and restored.
>
> gaps: S5.3 and S5.4 remain. S5.3 needs window-level budget figures (`conductor budget <run> --json` → `windows[]`), which likely means a third namespace in `corpus.json` and a branch in `src/lib/evidence.ts`; S5.4's measurements are already banked in the handoff and the ledger — its git ground truth sits in a private repo and must not be published as a ratio.

## Tracker handoff

```
last: **session 11** delivered **S5.1** (1ef5db5) and **S5.2**. QA of session 10: **no findings**
  — battery re-run green from a clean tree before any edit (0 errors, 45 tests, build exit 0, 255
  annotations, evidence gate green over 12 entries, all 74 citations resolve at `1632b9f`).
now on disk: articles 1 and 2, both figure-free prose (1,629 and 1,394 words) with every quantity
  in evidence keys. Battery: **0 errors, 49 tests, 306 annotations on 17 pages, evidence gate
  green over 13 cited entries.** The harvest now asks **`conductor money --run <id> --json` once
  per published run** (`readMoney`, +9.5s) — that is where `tokensPerCheckpoint`,
  `costPerMillionTokens`, `cacheReadShare` and the four `dearestStage*` keys come from.
  `refuseBudgetShaped` now tests a figure's **source**, not its name: budget-shaped keys ship
  only when `conductor money`/`conductor budget` answered them. Four new tests cover that.
next: **S5.3** (the measured-budget article) then **S5.4**. S5.3 needs window-level figures —
  `conductor budget <run> --json` gives `windows[]` with cap, nudge, floor, medianCloser,
  wrapUp, rolloverRate, tokensPerCheckpoint per window, and run-level `capPayoff`. Per-run keys
  must be uniform across all 18 runs, so a window namespace is probably needed in `corpus.json`
  plus a branch in `src/lib/evidence.ts`. **S5.4 is already measured, do not re-derive:** of
  `the-long-build`'s 34 rolled-over sessions, **0 recorded a commit, 34 recorded no gate summary,
  34 recorded no claim, 32 of 34 no result summary — but all 34 wrote a digest.** The git ground
  truth that contradicts it lives in a private repo, so it cannot be gate-verified: publish the
  artifact and describe the git check in words, printing no ratio for it.
open: **SPEC Part V article 1's `$51.98` / `23%` are now re-measured: `$52.06` / `23.2%`, 10
  sessions, 4 checkpoints** (`conductor money`, the-fleet-backlog's dearest stage). Concept 2's
  advisor split and concept 8's "push-only" corrections still stand. Bug #3 and bug #2 still
  open. **S7.1 must re-confirm `site`.**
tooling: prose refuses any number of two digits or more, and a currency/percent/decimal/ratio
  too — let the strip carry every quantity. **Never round-trip a content file through PowerShell
  `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`**: it mangled every em dash to mojibake and added a BOM this
  session (repaired with node). Mutate with node, restore with `npm run harvest` or git. Commit
  messages to a file, then `-F`. Battery is ~35s now, still fine in the foreground. **A failed
  Astro build exits 0xC0000409, not 1.** `conductor history --json` emits a UTF-8 BOM on Windows.
  **One run.db holds several runs** — filter by `run_id`, and `conductor money` needs `--run`.
