|---|---|---|---|
| S1.1 | The sixteen colour roles ship as CSS custom properties for both mocha and latte, lifted from the Face's own `color.go` rather than from upstream Catppuccin, with a test that fails when any role misses the Face's contrast bar (text ≥4.5:1, semantics and overlay ≥3:1, quiet roles ≥1.5:1 and ordered) | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.2 | Typography and spacing: a humanist sans body at a 62–72ch measure through the Astro Fonts API consuming `cssVariable`, monospace reserved for machine truth, and a type scale used by name — no page hardcodes a size or a hex | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.3 | The layout shell — top bar, three sections, reading column, sticky in-page TOC on wide viewports — plus a theme toggle that follows `prefers-color-scheme`, persists to `localStorage`, and survives first paint without a flash | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.4 | The template's two `checkPlaceholders` `allow:` escapes are deleted and the build is green without them, so this site's own copy is guarded from here on | ✅ DONE | [`b05efc3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/b05efc3) |

|---|---|---|---|
| S2.1 | `concepts`, `articles` and `reports` exist as typed collections — Zod-only schemas in `schema.ts`, loaders in `content.config.ts`, an entry each in the `editable` map — with the concept schema carrying the five-move shape from SPEC Part III including `evidence` as keys rather than values | ✅ DONE | [`a68c0f3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a68c0f3) |
| S2.2 | The three index pages and the nav render from the collections, ordered by `order`, with `readNext` resolving to real entries and a build that fails on a dangling one | ✅ DONE | [`a68c0f3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a68c0f3) |
| S2.3 | Every page carries `data-sk-edit` annotations that resolve, real `meta.description` and `meta.ogDescription`, and `npm run check` reports zero errors | ✅ DONE | [`a6d5f98`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a6d5f98) |
| S2.4 | One concept page is written end to end as the worked example that proves the shape holds, and it passes all three litmus tests in SPEC Part I | ✅ DONE | [`a6d5f98`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a6d5f98) |

| S3.1 | `scripts/harvest.mjs` reads `conductor history --json --limit 0` for run-level truth and read-only SQLite for what that does not expose (costs by category, gate pass rates, bugs, scores, event counts, rollovers), and writes `src/data/corpus.json` | ✅ DONE | - |
| S3.2 | `anonymise.json` maps run id → published scenario label, and the harvest **fails closed**: a run with no entry is excluded from the corpus rather than published under its real name, proven by a test that adds an unmapped run | ✅ DONE | - |
| S3.3 | The evidence strip component renders figures from `corpus.json` by key, and a page that names a key absent from the corpus fails the build rather than rendering blank | ✅ DONE | [`0f5f4c9`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/0f5f4c9) |
| S3.4 | The `evidence` gate re-runs the harvest and goes red when `corpus.json` is stale or a cited key is missing, proven by a deliberate staleness both ways | ✅ DONE | [`0f5f4c9`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/0f5f4c9) |

  commit, gate summary, claim, result summary and digest. **The trap, proven red and kept in
  `docs/evidence/S5.4-the-ledger-that-lied.md`: `commit_count` must be tested `> 0`, never
  `is not null`** — the null test publishes `53/53` and `287/287`, the exact inverse, formatted as
  a measurement. A test in `harvest.test.mjs` holds it.
next: **S6.1–S6.3**, the three reports, then **S6.4** `/runs`. SPEC Part VI is the authority: read
  **the rule** before the three report briefs, because a report is an article plus a `scenario`
  label and the anonymisation rule is the checkpoint's acceptance, not a preamble. S6.1 also owes
  a **check that greps the built output** for the forbidden list. The corpus already carries every
  per-run figure the reports need, and `reportSchema` already exists — this is writing, not
  machinery. Run labels come from `anonymise.json`; three July runs must be named **abandoned**.
open: git ground truth for the S5.4 article lives in a private repo — it is **described in words
  and published as no figure**, deliberately, and the page says so. SPEC Part V article 3's
  `26 costed`/`15.5M` are stale (now **30**/**16.8M**) and its `25–54M`/`12.8–15.3M` were
  stage-level, not windows — corrections are in `docs/evidence/S5.3-the-nudge-below-the-median.md`.
  SPEC Part V article 4's `19 of 34`/`10 of 11` are likewise unpublished on purpose. Article 1's
  `$52.06`/`23.2%` correction, concept 2's advisor split and concept 8's "push-only" still stand.
  Bugs #2 and #3 still open. **S7.1 must re-confirm `site`.**
tooling: prose refuses any number of two digits or more, and a currency/percent/decimal/ratio
  too — so a `file.cs:411` citation **cannot go in article prose**, and articles have no
  `citations` field; name it in words. **Never round-trip a content file through PowerShell
  `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`** (mojibake + BOM); mutate with node. `npm run content` rewraps
  YAML, so run it before quoting your own lines back. Commit messages to a file, then `-F`.
  Battery is ~60s now (the harvest makes two verb calls per run). **A failed Astro build exits
  0xC0000409, not 1.** `meta.description` caps at 160 chars and Astro reports it only as
  "does not match collection schema" until you re-run `npx astro check` for the detail.
  **Do not `select *` from `sessions` through `run_query`** — one row carries a whole digest and
  three of them cost more context than the rest of the orientation put together. `conductor history --json` emits a UTF-8 BOM on Windows. **One run.db holds
  several runs** — filter by `run_id`; `conductor money` needs `--run`, `conductor budget` takes
  the run id positionally.
