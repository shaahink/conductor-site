|---|---|---|---|
| S1.1 | The sixteen colour roles ship as CSS custom properties for both mocha and latte, lifted from the Face's own `color.go` rather than from upstream Catppuccin, with a test that fails when any role misses the Face's contrast bar (text ≥4.5:1, semantics and overlay ≥3:1, quiet roles ≥1.5:1 and ordered) | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.2 | Typography and spacing: a humanist sans body at a 62–72ch measure through the Astro Fonts API consuming `cssVariable`, monospace reserved for machine truth, and a type scale used by name — no page hardcodes a size or a hex | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.3 | The layout shell — top bar, three sections, reading column, sticky in-page TOC on wide viewports — plus a theme toggle that follows `prefers-color-scheme`, persists to `localStorage`, and survives first paint without a flash | ✅ DONE | [`f11fe55`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/f11fe55) |
| S1.4 | The template's two `checkPlaceholders` `allow:` escapes are deleted and the build is green without them, so this site's own copy is guarded from here on | ✅ DONE | [`b05efc3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/b05efc3) |

|---|---|---|---|
| S2.1 | `concepts`, `articles` and `reports` exist as typed collections — Zod-only schemas in `schema.ts`, loaders in `content.config.ts`, an entry each in the `editable` map — with the concept schema carrying the five-move shape from SPEC Part III including `evidence` as keys rather than values | ✅ DONE | [`a68c0f3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a68c0f3) |
| S2.2 | The three index pages and the nav render from the collections, ordered by `order`, with `readNext` resolving to real entries and a build that fails on a dangling one | ✅ DONE | [`a68c0f3`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a68c0f3) |
| S2.3 | Every page carries `data-sk-edit` annotations that resolve, real `meta.description` and `meta.ogDescription`, and `npm run check` reports zero errors | ✅ DONE | [`a6d5f98`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a6d5f98) |
| S2.4 | One concept page is written end to end as the worked example that proves the shape holds, and it passes all three litmus tests in SPEC Part I | ✅ DONE | [`a6d5f98`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/a6d5f98) |

| S3.1 | `scripts/harvest.mjs` reads `conductor history --json --limit 0` for run-level truth and read-only SQLite for what that does not expose (costs by category, gate pass rates, bugs, scores, event counts, rollovers), and writes `src/data/corpus.json` | ✅ DONE | - |
| S3.2 | `anonymise.json` maps run id → published scenario label, and the harvest **fails closed**: a run with no entry is excluded from the corpus rather than published under its real name, proven by a test that adds an unmapped run | ✅ DONE | - |
| S3.3 | The evidence strip component renders figures from `corpus.json` by key, and a page that names a key absent from the corpus fails the build rather than rendering blank | ✅ DONE | [`0f5f4c9`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/0f5f4c9) |
| S3.4 | The `evidence` gate re-runs the harvest and goes red when `corpus.json` is stale or a cited key is missing, proven by a deliberate staleness both ways | ✅ DONE | [`0f5f4c9`](https://github.com/shaahink/conductor-site/commit/0f5f4c9) |

> gaps: S4.3 not started and put back to TODO — but every citation for concepts 7 and 8 is researched, verified and banked in the knowledge ledger, so the next session writes rather than explores. Concept 6's `readNext` points back at concept 2 as a placeholder until concept 7 exists; S4.4 owns closing that chain.

## Tracker handoff

```
last: **session 9** delivered **S4.1** (690304d, 2a0e93e) and **S4.2** (931a40f). Six concept
  pages now exist and the spine reads in `order` from one to six. QA of session 8: no findings —
  battery re-run green from a clean tree, and the evidence gate proven red again by hand
  (`totalSessions` set to 999 → "committed 999 → store 340", exit 1; green on restore).
now on disk: concepts 1, 2, 5, 6 written (3 and 4 were earlier). New: `scripts/citations.mjs`
  opens every `inConductor.citations` entry against a conductor checkout and prints the line it
  landed on — **all 37 resolve at engine `1632b9f`**. The engine path comes from `CONDUCTOR_REPO`
  or the sibling directory, never from a file this public repo commits. The harvest now publishes
  the cost lanes: `totalAgentCostUsd`, `totalGateCostUsd`, `totalAdvisorCostUsd`. Battery: 0
  errors, 42 tests, 8 cited entries green, 14 pages, 154 annotations.
next: **S4.3** — concepts 7 and 8. **Every citation for both is already researched and verified
  in the knowledge ledger** (two notes, "S4.3 RESEARCH BANKED" and "concept 8"): do not re-derive
  them, go straight to writing. Then S4.4, which owns closing the `readNext` chain — concept 6
  currently points back at 2 as a placeholder, because a dangling slug fails the build.
open: **two SPEC figures corrected by measurement, do not retype either.** Part IV concept 2 says
  agent $3,015 vs advisor $0.09; the store has **three** categories and says agent $3,014.80,
  gate $1.26, advisor $0.24 — and the advisor line is priced from elapsed seconds, not metered,
  which the page labels. Part IV concept 8 calls the notification lane "push-only"; it long-polls
  and handles callbacks that write `control.json`. Bug #3 (Appendix A's `$9.37` and `~$10.85`
  divisions) and bug #2 (`--overlay` contrast) still stand. **S7.1 must re-confirm `site`.**
tooling: prose refuses any number of two digits or more — spell small quantities as words, and
  never write a decimal, a ratio or a currency amount into content. **Never `git checkout --` a
  file whose new version is uncommitted.** Commit messages to a file, then `-F`. The battery is
  ~20s, so foreground it. **A failed Astro build exits 0xC0000409, not 1.** `conductor history
  --json` emits a UTF-8 BOM on Windows. **One run.db holds several runs** — filter by `run_id`.
```
